# Markdown editor

## Features
- Build a frontend app with react in JavaScript.
- Use markdown to write articles.
- An article should include two fields, subject and `content`. The content is markdown.
- A list page to show all articles.
- A details page to show the article. The user can edit and preview at this page.
- The details page should provide a URL. The user can use the URL to access the article.
- Upload the source code to GitHub, Bitbucket or other services. And make sure we can access the project.

## Notes
- You can store data at the local storage or the memory.
- You can use any vendor packages.
- We don't need the backend server or API server.
- Please build a good architecture to integrate with RESTful APIs. Maybe we just change some code, this app will be work with API server.
